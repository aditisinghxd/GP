# Genetic Programming for Computationally Efficient Land Use Allocation Optimization

## Description

This repository is based on the work by **Moritz J. Hildemann, Alan T. Murray, and Judith A. Verstegen** as part of their study:

> **Genetic Programming for Computationally Efficient Land Use Allocation Optimization**  
> 12th International Conference on Geographic Information Science (GIScience 2023).

In their work, they introduced genetic programming for evolving functions that efficiently solve large-scale land use allocation problems, providing scalable and computationally efficient alternatives to standard optimization methods.

## Modifications

This repository contains:
- Modifications and extensions on top of the original implementation to run NSGA3 on raster data.
- Changes to the environment.yml file to include specific versions of the imports as other version combinations throw error.
- Changes to the filenames in the input data from German to English as the original name contained special characters and using it on different deskopts might create errors. 
- Added Plotly browser renderer setup:
  ```python
  import plotly.io as pio
  pio.renderers.default = "browser"

All modifications are by [Aditi Singh / @aditisinghxd], 2025.
